Global Temperature Anomaly Analysis
This project analyzes global temperature anomalies over time, focusing on the identification of trends, seasonal patterns, and forecasting future temperature anomalies. The analysis utilizes historical temperature data from 1880 to 2023, employing various statistical methods such as moving averages, seasonal decomposition, ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) modeling, and machine learning techniques, particularly Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models, to forecast future trends and provide insights into global climate change.

Key Features:
Data Segmentation: The dataset is divided into 10-year segments, from 1880 to 2023, for better trend analysis, with each segment being analyzed for overall temperature trends and seasonal patterns.

Trend Analysis: Moving averages and seasonal decomposition techniques are used to identify the underlying long-term trends, highlight periodic cycles, and understand the underlying noise in the data.

Statistical Testing: ADF (Augmented Dickey-Fuller) tests and other statistical tests (e.g., t-tests and ANOVA) are applied to confirm the stationarity of the data and validate the hypothesis of increasing global temperature anomalies.

ARIMA Model: The ARIMA model is employed to capture the autoregressive (AR), differencing (I), and moving average (MA) components in the data, with model parameters selected using auto.arima(). This model is validated through AIC, BIC, and residual diagnostics to forecast temperature anomalies.

LSTM Model: The Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model, a deep learning method, is used to capture complex patterns in the data and improve the forecasting accuracy beyond the traditional ARIMA model, especially in handling non-linear relationships in time series data.

Visualization: Key data visualizations are included, such as trend lines, seasonal decomposition plots, autocorrelation (ACF) and partial autocorrelation (PACF) plots, and forecast plots, to provide a clear and intuitive representation of the temperature anomalies and trends.

Forecasting: Both short-term and long-term forecasting of global temperature anomalies is performed using ARIMA and LSTM models. Forecast accuracy is evaluated using MAE, RMSE, and AIC metrics.

Data
The dataset used for this analysis includes global temperature anomaly data from 1880 to 2023. This data is publicly available from various sources like NOAA, NASA, and the Berkeley Earth dataset. Data preprocessing includes cleaning, handling missing values, and converting the data to a usable format for analysis.

Results
The findings from this analysis confirm the long-term upward trend in global temperature anomalies, with the most rapid warming observed in recent decades. The results highlight the importance of addressing climate change and its potential impact on ecosystems, weather patterns, and human life. The ARIMA and LSTM models both provide strong forecasting capabilities, with LSTM showing better performance in capturing non-linear dependencies and providing more accurate long-term forecasts.

Future Work
Hybrid Models: A hybrid model combining ARIMA and LSTM might be explored for better forecasting accuracy.

Additional Factors: The impact of other climatic factors like volcanic activity, solar variability, and human activity could be incorporated into the analysis for a more comprehensive climate model.

Real-Time Forecasting: Implementing real-time data processing and forecasting would enhance the model's applicability for current and future climate predictions.
